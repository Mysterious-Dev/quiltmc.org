## Qu'est-ce que Quilt ?

Quilt est une chaîne d'outils de modding développée principalement pour Minecraft, qui est dérivé du projet Fabric, principalement pour des raisons de problèmes de gouvernance, de gestion de projet et de modération. Vous pouvez en savoir plus sur le projet Quilt et son origine sur [la page À propos de nous](/fr/about).

</Message>

<Message>

## Quelles sont les parties de Fabric sur lesquelles Quilt s'appuie ?

Toutes. Quilt est un _hard fork_ de Fabric, et nous visons à dériver et maintenir tous les projets nécessaires pour exister indépendamment de ce dernier.

</Message>

<Message>

## Pourquoi devrais-je utiliser Quilt ?

Pour les utilisateurs, Quilt offre les avantages suivants :

- Des mods qui devraient être plus compatibles les uns avec les autres, malgré l'utilisation d'outils de modding puissants
- Compatibilité avec les mods Fabric et Quilt, ce qui signifie que vous n'avez pas besoin d'arrêter d'utiliser vos mods préférés.
- Une communauté officielle inclusive, transparente et amicale qui se préoccupe des questions sociales, dispose d'une équipe expérimentée et travaille avec ses utilisateurs pour s'améliorer au fil du temps.
- **Objectif futur:** Téléchargement automatique des bibliothèques de Quilt (qui peut être désactivé), afin que vous ayez toujours exactement, et uniquement, ce dont vous avez besoin pour que vos mods fonctionnent.

## How can I support Quilt?

If you'd like to help us out, here's just a few ways we've come up with:

- Join [our community spaces](/en/community), hang out and give your input
- Contribute to [our projects on GitHub](https://github.com/quiltmc), either directly or by providing reviews and opinions
- Support other projects that make use of Quilt, or Quilt's tools and libraries
- Talk about Quilt on social media (in a responsible manner)

[//]: # "* Help with ongoing costs by [supporting us financially on OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/quiltmc)"

Ultimately, even simply making use of Quilt or hanging out in our community spaces helps us. All activity, input and contributions are appreciated!

# Usage Questions

<Message>

## Can Quilt load Forge mods?

No, Quilt can't load Forge mods and support for this is not planned. There are third-party projects (such as Patchwork) that plan to add this functionality, but they're not maintained by Quilt -- and they're not part of The Quilt Project.

</Message>

## Can Quilt load Fabric mods?

In most cases, yes. As Quilt is a fork, most Fabric mods should be compatible with Quilt. As long as maintaining Fabric compatibility doesn't negatively impact the project, we'll keep doing it -- but if it does get to the point where maintaining it is no longer feasible, we'll help move it to a community-run project and provide its developers with the support they need to keep working on it.

It's also worth noting that -- as of this writing -- Fabric mods that contain mixin plugins are supported, but this will change in the future. This isn't a major issue as the vast majority of mods don't use mixin plugins, but we'll be happy to work with mod developers that need an alternative approach for Quilt.

## If I'm using Fabric mods, do I need Fabric API installed?

**No, you don't** - in fact, we recommend against this for compatibility reasons.

Many Quilt mods make use of the Quilt Standard Libraries (QSL), which are directly incompatible with Fabric API. To deal with this problem, QSL includes a special version of Fabric API which doesn't conflict -- it's part of the standard QSL distribution, which you can [download them from Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl).

As long as Fabric mods are correctly written to use only the intended public APIs from Fabric API, they should work correctly with QSL.

## Can Fabric load Quilt mods?

No. Quilt mods are distinct from Fabric mods, and not defined in the same way.

## When will Quilt be released?

Quilt's first beta released on the 20th of April 2022, and we've been full steam ahead since then!

If you'd like to try Quilt out, please take a look at [the install page](/en/install). [<i class="fas fa-cannabis has-text-dark is-pulled-right"></i>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJfg39WkMvE)

# Management Questions

<Message>

## How is Quilt structured?

Quilt's staff is split into three distinct groups:

- The Admin Board, which exists to oversee the project’s direction, manage permissions on GitHub, and break voting ties
- The Community Team, which handles community management and moderation tasks, as well as social media accounts and public relations
- The development teams, which independently oversee specific project that are assigned to them

Between these three groups, the structure is more or less flat -- no one group of people has the final say over the whole project. Additionally, the Community Team doesn't have direct ownership over any of the official community spaces, acting under the oversight of an otherwise uninvolved, elected keyholder.

You can find more about this in the governance section on [the About Us page](/en/about/#governance).

## What's an RFC? How do they work?

**RFC** is short for **R**equest **F**or **C**omments. The RFC process refers to a system whereby important process and policy changes, technical standards and definitions are created, discussed and approved by the community before being put into place. This is done by creating long-form documents that explain exactly what's being proposed, and what the rationale is for the proposal.

RFCs are proposed via a pull request to [the RFCs repository on GitHub](https://github.com/QuiltMC/rfcs), with the RFC number matching the pull request number (unless it's an amendment). Anyone is welcome to submit a proposal, but we recommend that anyone who's considering doing so talks with us about it on Discord, or raises an issue on GitHub.

Quilt's RFC process is documented in [RFC 0001: The RFC Process](https://github.com/QuiltMC/rfcs/blob/master/structure/0001-rfc-process.md).
